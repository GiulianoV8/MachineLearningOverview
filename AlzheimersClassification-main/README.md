# Alzheimer's Classification Machine Learning Model

This repository is for a machine learning model that can detect and subsequently classify Alzheimer's Disease given an MRI brain scan. 
Alzheimer_Classification.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook containing the code and a display of the model. 
AlzheimersData contains a folder for model checkpoints/saved weights and 3 other folders for training, testing, and validation datasets.
The model classifies MRI scans into 4 groups: non-demented, very mildly demented, mildly demented, and demented
